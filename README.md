Purpose of VcfHunter
====================

Scaffhunter regroups several programs which principal aims are to work and visualize genetic 
mapping data. In addition to 2D visualization of linkage between markers, these tools can be 
used to order scaffolds without passing by the tedious step of genetic map construction and 
reconciliation between marker order in scaffold and marker order in the genetic map.

Installation
------------

All proposed tools described here are written in python and work on linux system
To install the tools:
1- unzip the tar.gz file with the following command line : tar -xvzf <archive-file>
